The point of configure is, as the doctest says, to initialize all of the places in the AntColony. If you're asking how how we can call colony.places, you can see in configure, there is an assignment to self.places which sets it to an OrderedDict object. This creates an instance attribute in our AntColony object that will hold all the places and register_place will use its name as the key in the OrderedDict.  Because configure is called in the constructor, this means that all AntColony objects will have an instance attribute called places which holds all of the place objects in the Colony. The actual initialization of the places is done in create_places. Notice that this isn't accessing self.places, but **creating** it since it doesn't already exist by the time configure is called.  In register_place, the only time beehive is used is when the place we are registering is where the bees enter from. This is important since the bees must enter from somewhere once they exit the hive, and this part of the code accounts for it."

                    "feedback": "Thanks for the reply, I have a much better understanding! But out of curiosity, inside the **register_place** method how are we registering where the bees enter from. Aren't we just registering the actual beehive, which is this line                self.places[place.name] = place  Also, how come when we are calling **create_places** we don't pass in **self.places**? Sorry if my questions are not well worded or just don't make sense."

You can see in the test case that they pass in as the parameter create_places the dry_layout function. I've pasted both dry_layout and wet_layout for your convenience (Both are from the bottom of ants.py)                def wet_layout(queen, register_place, tunnels=3, length=9, moat_frequency=3):         \"\"\"Register a mix of wet and and dry places.\"\"\"         for tunnel in range(tunnels):             exit = queen             for step in range(length):                 if moat_frequency != 0 and (step + 1) % moat_frequency == 0:                     exit = Water('water_{0}_{1}'.format(tunnel, step), exit)                 else:                     exit = Place('tunnel_{0}_{1}'.format(tunnel, step), exit)                 register_place(exit, step == length - 1)          def dry_layout(queen, register_place, tunnels=3, length=9):         \"\"\"Register dry tunnels.\"\"\"         wet_layout(queen, register_place, tunnels, length, 0)  You can see that neither of these functions take in a list of places to mutate, but rather a function that defines how to register the places once they are created. The reason we don't pass in self.places is because having a function that tells these functions how to register places into self.places is a lot more convenient and general if we ever change the way we register places in the future.  If we give it the register_place function, that function essentially has access to self.places, so it will mutate it for us. Notice that register_place in wet_layout is called **every time a new place is made and not just for the beehive**. This is how we're able to get every place into self.places and not just the beehive."

Does the beehive count as a place? According to the Game Layout, the beehive seems to be off the grid. If it is an instance of the Place class, does that mean that beehive.exit = P2 and P2.entrance = Beehive?  2\\. Since the answer to my initial question is beehive, I'm assuming that the \"first place in the tunnel\" is P2. Is that because all the bees in the tunnel start in beehive.exit = P2 or is there another reason?  3\\. If an AntColony had dimension(m,n) where m > 1\\. There would be m number of tunnels, correct? Would the beehive still be in the same place (at the end of 1st tunnel)?",
