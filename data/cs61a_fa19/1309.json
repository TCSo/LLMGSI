It seems to me that the test case is testing the range of the long_thrower ant, and my ant is correctly not throwing at the one 4 spaces away but is also not throwing at the one five spaces away. I wasn't sure if this was an issue with the ranges or the shooting mechanism, but if I change the min_range to 4, my ant shoots at the bees just fine. This makes me think that the issue is with the ranges themselves, but aren't those fixed? Can give me some insight into what I'm doing wrong or how the ranges are meant to be implemented?",
